# React Image Map Resizer
This is a simple library that makes HTML Image Maps responsive, so that they automatically stay scaled to the size of the image they are attached to using a React hook and native html img and map elements. It detects the window being resized and updates the co-ordinates of the image map accordingly.

This is a port of the image_map_resizer vanilla js made by @davidjbradshaw to a simple reusable hook for React applications.
